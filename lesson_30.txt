# Docker Networks: DNS

- You can't on IP addresses inside containers as things are
  so dynamic.
- Static IP's are an anti pattern when it comes to containers.
- When you create a container attached to another network other
  than the default one, it gets a special new feature, which is
  automatic DNS resolution for all the containers on this virtual
  network.
- Docker defaults the hostname to the container's name, but you
  can also set aliases.
- Always use custom network as you don't to create manual
  links all the time.

## Commands

### Create two new container on the same network

$ docker network create my_app_net
$ docker container run -d --name my_nginx --network my_app_net nginx:alpine
$ docker container run -d --name new_nginx --network my_app_net nginx:alpine

### See if containers are actually on the same network

$ docker network inspect my_app_net

### Testing name resolution between those two containers

$ docker container exec -it my_nginx ping new_nginx
