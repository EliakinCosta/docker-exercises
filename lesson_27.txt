# Docker Networks

- Docker has a concept of batteries included, but removable.
- For local dev/testing networks usually just work.
- When you start a container, you're connecting to a private
  virtual network called bridge.
- Each virtual network routes through NAT firewall on host IP.
- All containers on the same virtual network can talk to each other
  without opening ports on your physical network (-p).
- Best practice is to create a new virtual network for each app
   - network "my_web_app" for mysql and php/apache containers
   - network "my_api" for mongo and nodejs containers.
- You can make new virtual Networks
- You can attach a container to more than one virtual
  virtual network or even none
- Skip virtual networks and host IP (--net=host)
- We can use different Docker network drivers
