What happens in 'docker container run'

1. Looks for that image locally in image cache, doesn't find anything
2. Then looks in remote image repository (default is Docker Hub)
3. Downloads the latest version or the version specified
4. Creates new container based on that image and prepares to start
5. Gives it a virtual IP on a private network inside docker engine
6. If bind was made, it opens up port port on host and forward to port
   in container
7. Starts container by using the CMD in the image Dockerfile
