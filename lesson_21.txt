Container vs VM

Container
-  You don't need a GUEST OS
-  The docker daemon manages everything required
   to run and interact with docker containers
-  Libs are built within the Docker image
-  Containers are just processes
-  Limited to resources they can access
-  Exit when process stops

VM
-  Self contained computer packed into a single file
-  That file is executed by the Hypervisor
-  Each VM has its own GUEST OS
-  As they are more isolated, you do need to install
   the same lib on each VM
